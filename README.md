# keras MAC cell

Keras adaptation of the article [Compositional Attention Networks for Machine Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.03067.pdf).

Still work in progress, but maybe making it public can help me figure out what is missing.

List of DONEs:
- numpy arrays dimensions pass correctly before fitting
- gradients pass correctly
- training works, but the performance is still low

List of main TODOs:
- ResNet50 to ResNet101
- implement the full WriteUnit
- otherwise figure out what's the source of the low performance
